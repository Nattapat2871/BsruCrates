A highly flexible and powerful crate system for modern Spigot/Paper servers. bsruCrates moves beyond traditional random gacha crates by allowing players to **choose their desired reward** from a GUI. It features a unique, dual-key system, allowing crates to be opened with either physical key items or a virtual point currency.

This plugin is designed for server owners who want to reward their players with valuable, specific items (including custom items from other plugins) in a balanced and engaging way.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Player-Choice Rewards:** Instead of random luck, players right-click a crate and choose the exact reward they want from a GUI.
- **Dual-Key System:** Every crate can be opened with one of two methods, with physical keys always taking priority:
    1.  **Physical Keys:** Unique, NBT-tagged items that cannot be faked. Admins can give these to players.
    2.  **Points System:** A virtual currency, stored per-player and per-crate-type. Ideal for rewards from voting, quests, or your server's economy.
- **In-Game Crate Editor:**
    - **`/bsrucrates additem <type> <slot>`:** Add any item to a crate's reward GUI directly from your hand, preserving all custom names, lore, enchantments, and NBT data from other plugins.
    - **`/bsrucrates removeitem <type> <slot>`:** Easily remove rewards from the GUI.
- **Two-Step Confirmation:** A confirmation screen prevents accidental purchases, ensuring players are certain about their choice.
- **Full Admin Control:** A comprehensive suite of commands to manage every aspect of the plugin:
    - Create/remove crate blocks in the world.
    - Give physical keys.
    - Manage player points (give/set/take).
    - Reload all configurations live.
- **Highly Configurable:** Customize all messages, GUI titles, and sound effects for a unique server experience.
- **PlaceholderAPI Support:** Display player key counts and points anywhere on your server.
